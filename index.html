        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p>
          Building modular, broker-agnostic tools to help retail
          investors and traders understand performance, risk, and
          behavior — without locking them into someone else’s idea of
          how things should work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focused on clarity, autonomy, and practical insight.

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          A lightweight, self-hostable analytics platform for retail
          investors and traders.  Structured backend. Visual,
          expressive frontend. Built with conviction.
        </p>

        Solving for:
        <ul>
          <li>Transaction-level performance tracking</li>
          <li>Currency effects</li>
          <li>Behavior-aware insights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is an independent project, evolving quietly and deliberately.
          I’m building, testing, and dogfooding it on real retail data.
