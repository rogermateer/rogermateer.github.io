  <h1>Hi, I’m Roger.</h1>
  <h2>Engineer. Thinker. Builder of Quietly Ambitious Tools.</h2>

  <p>
    I’m currently building a data analysis platform for independent investors and traders — 
    something that helps real people make better portfolio decisions with more clarity and confidence. 
    It combines a structured backend engine with a rich, visual interface designed to bring insight 
    and accountability into the investment process.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm especially interested in solving problems around transaction-level tracking, foreign exchange 
    effects, and performance measurement — without assuming you're a hedge fund or a spreadsheet ninja.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an independent project, evolving quietly and deliberately. For now, I’m building, testing, 
    and dogfooding it on real retail data. If you're curious or working on something similar, feel free 
    to <a href="mailto:rogermateer@gmail.com">reach out</a>.
  </p>

  <p>More soon.</p>
